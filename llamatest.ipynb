However, now we're much closer to knowing with the rise of artificial intelligence and to be more specific generative AI. So what is generative AI? Put simply, generative AI is artificial intelligence that can generate new content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data. Perhaps in the last few weeks you've heard more and more about Open AI and their new product, chat, GPT. It's been trending on Twitter and has a massed over a million users in just five days, which in itself is mind-blowing, having launched on 30 November 2022. But what is chat GPT? What is Open AI? And how does this revolution-reteknology actually work? Here's how it happened.

Dali 2 is a new AI system from Open AI that can take simple text descriptions like a quality dunking a basketball and turn them into photo realistic images that have never existed before. Open AI, the business, was founded in 2015 by Sam Altman and you guessed it Elon Musk. Musk stepped down in February 2018 to focus on Tesla, but remains a donor and adviser to the business. Their goal at the time was to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity. At its core, Open AI is an artificial intelligence research business that is shifted from non-profit to cat profit. Despite no longer working day today at Open AI, Elon Musk thinks that its latest program, chat GPT, is scary good.

Meta have also launched Blenderbot 3 in August, but again it fell down for similar reasons, as well as providing false information, even to questions like who became president in 2020, suggesting Trump had won. Open AI is trying to avoid these kinks by employing moderation API, a moderation system that assists developers to show when things go against their content policy, like illegal or unsafe information. It's not a 100 percent accurate, but it certainly helps. Alongside chat GPT and Dali 2 is GPT 3, a natural language system that can also write, argue and code, and chat GPT uses an upgraded version of this to create text at incredible speeds, so that brings us onto chat GPT.

It corrects grammar, it summarizes difficult texts into simple concepts, it converts movies into emojis, and it fixes bugs in Python code. Chat GPT was first opened up to beta testing in November 2021 through the playground, and it's launched this year, it's supposed to be an improvement on GPT 3, as to not provide any harmful outputs.
